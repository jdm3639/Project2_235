    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <p> We used the API at <a href="https://dog.ceo/dog-api/">https://dog.ceo/dog-api/</a> to get images and breeds of dogs, and the default image of a dog when
        you click “Load Breed Finder” is from this website too. Our initial plan was to make a game where you select a
        picture of a dog based on its breed. We succeeded at this, and added some additional options (a hard mode and a
        breed finder mode) to fulfill the requirements.
        To learn how to use this API, we used the information at <a href="https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/">https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/</a>, but found
        the endpoints at the bottom of <a href="https://github.com/ElliottLandsborough/dog-ceo-api">https://github.com/ElliottLandsborough/dog-ceo-api</a> more helpful.

        Josh did the majority of the Javascript (which is by far the biggest file), and I (Christian) did the majority of the HTML, CSS and documentation. Each of us helped with everything though; we pretty much worked on the whole thing while sitting next to eachother, so we were constantly asking each other about things and pushing/pulling via Github.
        <br> <br>
        One thing to notice: Your high score is saved in the Guess the Breed modes; one for the easy mode, and one for
        the hard mode. This is how we use local storage.
